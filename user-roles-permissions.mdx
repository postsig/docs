## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can a contract live in multiple folders?">
    No, a contract can only exist in one folder at a time. If you need to reorganize contracts, you must move them from one folder to another rather than having them appear in multiple folders simultaneously.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When folders are created, who has access to that folder by default?">
    By default, only Admin users have access to newly created folders. Admins must explicitly share folders with other users to grant them access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do managers have access to all contracts?">
    No, Managers only have access to:
    - Contracts that are specifically assigned to them
    - Contracts that they personally upload

    They do not have organization-wide access to all contracts like Admins do.
